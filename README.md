For my final project at George Washington University, I designed a machine learning model that predicted whether or not a home would sell in Los Angeles a four year period. 

As a part of my previous job, I had access to neighborhood data which we call 'farms' in the industry. These data sheets contain information like owner names, property info, but most importantly - <b>financial information</b>.

- [x] Assessed Value
- [x] Tax Amount
- [x] Date of Purchase
- [x] Loan Amount

Now, Los Angeles is a big place, so this study focused on the 7 key neighborhood, as shown below.
