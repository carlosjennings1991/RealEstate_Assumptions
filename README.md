# Real Estate Assumptions

Challenging your assumptions about the Real Estate market, specifically who is selling and who is not.

___

For my final project at George Washington University, I designed a machine learning model that predicted whether or not a home would sell in Los Angeles a four year period. 

As a part of my previous job, I had access to neighborhood data which we call 'farms' in the industry. These data sheets contain information like owner names, property info, but most importantly - <b>financial information</b>.

- [x] Assessed Value
- [x] Tax Amount
- [x] Date of Purchase
- [x] Loan Amount

Now, Los Angeles is a big place, so this study focused on the 7 key neighborhood, as shown below.

The mechanics of the machine learning model can be found here - https://github.com/mhorstman/Final_Project_Team_1, the purpose of this repo is to showcase the very suprising finding about <i>who</i> is selling. 

### Assumption 1: Those who have lived in their homes the longest are more likely to sell

<i> i.e the downsizing Baby Boomer </i>

Since 2011, <b>2 Million Baby Boomers</b> have retired per year. Are they the largest segment of sellers?

##

### Assumption 2: Those with the most equity are more likely to sell. 

<i> i.e cashing out, plain and simple </i>

Are sky-high valuations prompting owners with tons of equity into selling?

##

### Assumption 3: Those with the lowest, or absent, loan burdens are most likely to sell.

<i> i.e nothing keeping them there </i>

<b>38 percent</b> or owner-occupied units are owned free and clear. Without a mortgage tieing them to the property, are these people moving?

## Results:

It turns out, all of this assumptions are wildly incorrect. Granted, twenty years ago they may have been true with the GI Generation/Silent Generation taking the place of the Boomer generation, but a lot has changed in 20 years, especially in Los Angeles. 

The image below is the breakdown of several key stats in each neighborhood, comparing sellers vs non-sellers.
